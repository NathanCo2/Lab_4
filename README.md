Lab 04 Program Description:

The objective of this lab is to develop a real-time scheduler and test its performance. The scheduler allows the program to perform multitasking between various components of our system. Utilizing the code developed in previous labs, our team created a code that contains two tasks capable of running two motors under closed-loop control simultaneously. To test the code we examined the motor simultaneously through different distances and held them at the desired positions. To compare the positions between the two motors, both positions were captured and plotted in Figure 1 and a close-up in Figure 2.
